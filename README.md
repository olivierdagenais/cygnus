Automated Cygwin installation and configuration.

## History

It appears [a reply by Ralph Hempel in the **Re: Customizable cygwin setup.exe** thread](http://cygwin.1069669.n5.nabble.com/Customizable-cygwin-setup-exe-tp81881p81882.html) is what started this project.

 [Will Rogers](https://github.com/wjrogers) then [published a gist called `install.bat`](https://gist.github.com/wjrogers/1016065).

[RT Wolf](https://github.com/rtwolf) then published [the `rtwolf/cygwin-auto-install` repo](https://github.com/rtwolf/cygwin-auto-install/) to GitHub.

Finally, [Olivier Dagenais](https://github.com/olivierdagenais) forked the aforementioned repository and incorporated some ideas from [Tomek Bujok](https://github.com/tombujok)'s [Babun](https://github.com/babun/babun) project and [Stephen Jungels](https://github.com/transcode-open)'s [apt-cyg](https://github.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg) tool.
